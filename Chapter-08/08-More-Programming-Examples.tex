n this chapter we apply some of the FORTH tools we have been

developing (complex arithmetic, typed data) to two standard
problems in numerical analysis: numerical integration of a func-
tion over a deﬁnite interval; determining the function of a given
form that most closely fits a set of data.

51 Numerlcal Integration

We begin by deﬁning the deﬁnite integral of a function f(x). Then
we discuss some methods for (numerically) approximating the
integral. This process is called numerical integration or numeri-
cal quadrature. Finally, we write some FORTH programs based
on the various methods we describe.

Flg. 8-1 The Integral of a function Is the area under me curve.

We estimate the integral by breaking up the area into narrow
rectangles of width w that approximate the height of the curve at
that point and then adding the areas of the rectanglesl. For
rectangles of non-zero width the method gives an approximation.
If we calculate with rectangles that consistently protrude above
the curve (assume for simplicity the curve lies above the x-axis),
and with rectangles that consistently lie below the curve, we
capture the exact area between two approximations. We say that
we have bounded the integral above and below. In mathematical

language.

Similarly, the lower bound will be low by about the same amount.
This means that if we halve w (by taking twice as many points),
the accuracy of the approximation will double. The mathematical

deﬁnition of f:f(x) dr is the number we get by taking the limit as

the width w of the rectangles becomes arbitrarily small. We know
that such a limit exists because the actual area has been captured
between lower and upper bounds that shrink together as we take
more points.

Suppose we think of It‘/Ix) dz as a function —eall it F(b) — of

Equation 3 is a fancy way to say that integration and differentia-
tion are inverse operations in the same sense as multiplication
and division, or addition and subtraction.

This fact lets us calculate a definite integral using the differential ‘
equation routine developed in Chapter 6. We can express the
problem in the following form: ‘

Solve the differential equation

I =f(x) (4)
fromx = a tox = b, subject to the initial condition

 

F(a) = 0.
The desired integral is F (b).

evaluate a deﬁnite integral is that it gives us no error criterion

§§3 Monte-Carlo method
The area under f(x) is exactly equal to the average heightfof
f(x) on the interval [a, b], times the length, b—a, of the interval .
How can we estimate]? One method is to sample f(x) at random.

 

This is not strictly correct: one could use a differential equation solver of the “predictor/come-
tor" variety, with variable step-size, to integrate Eq. 4. See, e.g., Press, er al., Numerical Recipe:

Smce the error decreases only as W , whereas even so crude a

Monte-Carlo methods come into their own for multidimensional
integrals, where they are much faster than multiple one-dimen-
sional integration subroutines based on deterministic rules.

§§3—2 A slmple Monte-Cane program

Following the function protocol and naming convention devel-
oped in Ch. 6 §1§§3.2, we invoke the integration routine via

USE( Ename % L.lim 96 U.lim % err )MONTE

We pass )MONTE the name Ename of the function f(x), the
limits of integration, and the absolute precision of the answer.
The answer should be left on the ifstack. L. Ilm, U. Ilm and err
stand for explicit ﬂoating point numbers that are placed on the
87stack by 965 Th.e word 96 appears explicitly because 1n a larger
program — of which )MONTE could be but a portion— we might
want to specify the parameters as numbers already on the 87stack.
Since this is intended to be an illustrative program we keep the
fstack simple by defining SCALARs to put the limits and
precision into.

The word INITIALIZE will be responsible for storing these num-

(prng’s) from Ch. 3 55. We need a word to transform pm’s

§§4 Adaptlve methods

The word DEBUG is included to produce useful output every 10
points as an aid to testing. The ﬁnal version of the program need
not include DEBUG, of course. Also it would presumably be ‘
prudent to BEHEAD all the internal variables.

The chief virtue of the program we have just written is that it is
easily generalized to an arbitrary number of dimensions. The
generalization is left as an exercise.

Obviously, to minimize the execution time of an integration
subroutine requires that we minimize the number of times the 3
function f(x) has to be evaluated. There are two aspects to this:

0 First, we must evaluate f(x) only once at each point x in the

interval. .

TI

0 Second, we evaluate f(x) more densely where it varies rapidly
than where it varies slowly. Algorithms that can do this are
called adaptive.

To apply adaptive methods to Monte Carlo integration, we need:

mafia

 

an algorithm that biases the sampling method so more points are :5

chosen where the function varies rapidly. Techniques for doing
this are known generically as stratified sampling6.111e difﬁculty
of automating stratiﬁed sampling for general functions puts adap-
tive Monte Carlo techniques beyond the scope of this book.

However, adaptive methods can be applied quite easily to deter-
ministic quadrature formulae such as the trapezoidal rule or
Simpson’s rule. Adaptive quadrature is both interesting in its own
right and illustrates a new class of programming techniques, so
we pursue it in some detail.

Adaptive Integration on the real line

We are now going to write an adaptive program to integrate an
arbitrary function ﬂx), specified at run- -time, over an
arbitrary interval of the x- axis, with an absolute precision
speciﬁed in advance. We write the integral as a function of several
arguments, once again to be invoked following Ch. 6 §1.3.2:

USE( Ename % L.lim % U.lim 96 err )INTEGRAL

Now, how do we ensure that the routine takes a lot of points when
the function f(x) is rapidly varying, but few when f(x) is smooth?
The simplest method uses recursion7.

“5-1 Dlgresslon on recursive algorithms

We have so far not discussed recursion, wherein a program calls
itself directly or indirectly (by calling a second routine that
then calls the ﬁrst).

Since there is no way to know a priori how many times a program
will call itself, memory allocation for the arguments must be
dynamic. That is, a recursive routine places its arguments on a

stack so each invocation of the program can ﬁnd them. This is the
method employed in recursive compiled languages such as Pascal,
C or modern BASIC. Recursion is of course natural in FORTH
since stacks are intrinsic to the language.

We illustrate with the problem of ﬁndin the greatest common
divisor (gcd) of two integers. Euclid devised a rapid algo-

rithm for ﬁnding the gcd9 which can be expressed symbolically
as

_ u, v=0

That is, the problem of ﬁnding the gcd of u and v can be replaced
by the problem of ﬁnding the gcd of two much smaller numbers.

Most FORTHs do not permit a word to call itself by name; the reason is that when the compiler
tries to compile the self-reference, the deﬁnition has not yet been completed and so cannot be
looked up in the dictionary. Instead, we use RECURSE to stand for the name of the self-calling
word. See Note 14 below.

Note how GCD successively calls itself, placing the same address
(displayed in hexadecimal notation) on the rstack, until the stop-
ping criterion is satisﬁed.

Recursion can get into difﬁculties by exhausting the stack or
rstack. Since the stack in 600 never contains more than three
numbers, only the rstack must be worried about in this example.

ecursive programming possesses an undeserved reputation

or slog execution, compared with nonrecursive equivalent
programs . Compiled languages that permit recursion —e.g.,
BASIC, C, Pascal— generally waste time passing arguments to
subroutines, Le. recursive routines in these languages are slowed
by parasitic ailing overhead. FORTH does not suffer from this
speed penalty, since it uses the stack directly.

Nevertheless, not all algorithms should be formulated recursive-
ly. A disastrous example is the Fibonacci sequence

F0 = 0, F1: 1, F“ = Fn—l '1' Fn-2 (11)
expressed recursively in FORTH as

:FIB (:n--F[n])
DUP 0> NOT
IF DROP o EXIT THEN

IF DROP 1 EXIT THEN \n > 1

1- DUP 1- (-- n-1 n-2)
RECURSE SWAP (- - F[n-2] n-1 )
RECURSE + ;

This program is vastly slower than the nonrecursive version
below, that uses an explicit DO loop:

:FIB (:n--F[n])
0 1 HOT (:01 n)
DUP O> NOT
IF DDROP EXIT THEN
DUP 1 =

IF DROP PLUCK EXIT THEN
1 DO UNDER + LOOP PLUCK ;

Why was recursion so bad for Fibonacci numbers? Suppose the
running time for F n is T,, ; then we have

T, ~ T.,_1 + T,,_2 + r (12)

where r is the integer addition time. The solution of Eq. 12 is

n
r, = «Dz—‘5) — 1] (13)

That is, the execution time increases exponentially with the size
of the problem. The reason for this is simple: recursion managed
to replace the original problem by two of nearly the same size, Le.
recursion nearly doubled the work at each step!

The preceding analysis of why recursion was bad suggests how ,
recursion can be helpful: we should apply it whenever a given :

ms-MWW 189

problem can be replaced by -say- two problems of half the
original size, that can be recombined in n or fewer operations. An
example is mergesort, where we divide the list to be sorted into
two roughly equal lists, sort each and then merge them:
subroutine sort(|ist[0,n])

partition' (list, 11811, 11312)

sortaistl)

sort(list2)

mergeaisn, list2, list)

In such cases the running time is
Tn'Tv2+Tv2+ﬂ=Zruz+n (14)
for which the solution is
Tn~nlog1(n) (15)

(In fact, the running time for mergeson is comparable with the
fastest sorting algorithms.) Algorithms that subdivide problems
in this way are said to be of divide and conquer type.

Adaptive integration can be expressed as a divide and conquer

algorithm, hence recursion can simplify the program. In pseu-
docode (actually QuicltBasicO ) we have the program shown
below.

function simpson(f, a, b)

c = (a + b)/2

simpson = (1(a) + 1(b) + 4*f(c)) " (b - a) /6

Clearly, there is no obligation to use Simpson's rule on the sub-
intervals: any favorite algorithm will do.

To translate the above into FORTH, we decompose into smaller
parts. The name of the function representing the integrand (ac-
tually its execution address or cfa) is placed on the stack by USE( ,
as in Ch. 8 §1.3.2 above. Thence it can be saved in a local variable
—either on the rstack or in a VAR or VARIABLE that can be
BEHEADed — so the corresponding phrases

R@ EXECUTE \rstack
name EXECUTE \VAFI
name EXECUTE@ \VARIABLE

evaluate the integrand. Clearly the limits and error (or tolerance)
must be placed on a stack of some sort, so the function can call
itself. One simple possibility is to put the arguments on the
87stack itself. (Of course we then need a software fstack manager
to extend the limited 87stack into memory, as discussed in
Ch. 4 §7.) Alternatively, we could use the intelligent fstack
(ifstack) discussed in Ch. 5 §2.5. We thus imagine the fstack to be
as deep as necessary.

The program then takes the form13 shown on p. 171 below.

Note that in going from the pseudocode to FORTH we replaced
)INTEGRAL by RECURSE inside the word )INTEGRAL The
need for this arises from an ideosyncrasy of FORTH: normally
words do not refer to themselves, hence a word being deﬁned is
hidden from the dictionary search mechanism (compiler) until
the ﬁnal ; is reached. The word RECURSE unhides the current
name, and compiles its cfa in the proper spot“.

For generality we do not specify the integration rule for sub-intervals, but factor it into its own
word. If we want to change the rule, we then need redeﬁne but one component (actually two,
since the Richardson extrapolation —see Appendix 8.C— needs to be changed also).

We may deﬁne RECURSE (in reverse order) as

“5-2 Disadvantages of recursion in adaptive Integration
The main advantage of the recursive adaptive integration algo-
rithm is its ease of programming. As we shall see, the recursive
program is much shorter than the non-recursive one. For any
reasonable integrand, the fstack (or ifstack) depth grows only as
the square of the logarithm of the ﬁnest subdivision, hence never

gets too large.

However, recursion has several disadvantages when applied to

numerical quadrature:

e The recursive program evaluates the function more times than

necessary.

0 It would be hard to nest the function )INTEGRAL for multi-

dimensional integrals.

Several solutions to these problems suggest themselves:

0 The best, as we shall see, is to eliminate recursion from the

algorithm.

a We can reduce the number of function evaluations with a more
precise quadrature formula on the sub-intervals.

OWVNoUolm-me.

172

Chapter 11 — More Programming Examples Scientiﬁc FORTH

e We can use “0 n" formulas like Gauss-Legendre, that omit
the endpoints see Appendix 8.1).

§§s-3 Adaptive Integration without recursion

he chief reason to write a non-recursive program is to avoid

any repeated evaluation of the integrand. That is, the optimum
is not only the smallest number of points it, in (A, B] consistent
with the desired precision, but to evaluate f(x) once only at each
x... This will be worthwhile when the integrand f(x) is costly to
evaluate.

To minimize evaluations of f(x), we shall have to save values
f(x,,) that can be re-uscd as we subdivide the intervals.

The best place to store the f(x,,)’s is some kind of stack or array.
Moreover, to make sure that a value of f(x) computed at one
mesh size is usable at all smaller meshes, we must subdivide into
two equal sub-intervals; and the points 1:“ must be equally spaced
and include the end-points. Gaussian quadrature is thus out of
the question since it invariably (because of the non-uniform
spacings of the points) demands that previously computed f(x,,)’s
are thrown away because they cannot be re-used.

The simplest quadrature formula that satisﬁes these criteria is the
trapezoidal rule (see Appendix 8.2). This is the formula used in
the following program.

To clarify what we are going to do, let us visualize the interval of
integration, and mark the mesh points (where we evaluate ﬂx)

Notice that, although t/f is perfectly ﬁnite atx = 0, its ﬁrst derivav
tive is not. This is not a problem in the above case, because the:
lower limit is 1.0.

It is an instructive exercise to run the above example with the'
limits (0.0, 1.0). The adaptive routine spends many iterations:
approachingx = 0 (25 in the range [0,, 0.0625] vs. 25 in the ranger:
[0.0625, 1.0] ). This is a concrete example of how an adaptive-1
routine will unerringly locate the (integrable) singularities of at
function by spending lots of time near them. The best answer to:
this problem is to separate out the bad parts of a function by hand...
if possible, and integrate them by some other algorithm that take
the singularities into account. By the same token, one shoul
always integrate up to, but not through, a discontinuity in f(x).

We often want to evaluate the complex integral

1 - +1 «21.1: (16)

where I‘ is a contour (simple, closed, piecewise tinuous curve)
in the complex z-plane, and 1(2) is an analytic1 function of z.

The easiest way to evaluate 16 is to parameterize 2 as a function
of a real variable t ; as 1 runs from A to B, z(t) traces out the
contour. For example, the parameten'zation

z(t) = 20 + R cos(t) + iR sin(t) , 05152: (17)

traces out a (closed) circle of radius R centered at 2 =20

We assume that the derivative 2(t) E E can be deﬁned; then the

dt
integral 16 can be re-written as one over a real interval, with a
complex integrand:
I = Ii 2(1)f(z(1)) d: (18)

Now our previously deﬁned adaptive function )INTEGRAL can
be applied directly, with Emma the name of a complex funcan

One of the, most important applications of numerical analysis is
the representation of numerical data in functional form. This
includes ﬁtting, smoothing, filtering, interpolating, etc.

A typical example is the problem of table lookup: a program re-
quires values of some mathematical function —sin(x), say — for
arbitrary values of x. The function is moderately or extremely
time-consuming to compute directly. According to the Intel tim-

oJuthNobIolm—Mmmarvod.

ings for the 801187 chip, this operation should take about 8 tim
longer than a floating point multiply. In some real-time app '
tions this may be too slow.

There are several ways to speed up the computation of a functit
They are all based on compact representations of the fun '
-—either in tabular form or as coefﬁcients of functions that a
faster to evaluate. For example, we might represent sin(x) by'
simple polynomial1

sin(x) ~x (0.994108 - 0.1472021) , (22) 1

,_
I
accurate to better than 1% over the range -% S x 5 g , thg'

requires but 3 multiplications and an addition to evaluate.
would be twice as fast as calculating sin(x) on the 80x87 chip1 .2

To achieve substantially greater speed requires table look-It]:

To locate data in an ordered table, we might employ binar3
search: that is, look at the x-value halfway down the table and se
if the desired value is greater or less than that. On the averag.
log2(N) comparisons are required, where N is the length of tla
table. For a table with 1% precision, we might need 128 entriet
i.e. seven comparisons.

 

Binary search is unacceptably slow — is there a faster methodl
In fact, assuming an ordered table of equally-spaced abscissae tlu
fastest way to locate the desired x-value is hashing, a method it!
computing the address rather than ﬁnding it using comparisom
Suppose, as before, we need 1% accuracy, i.e. a 128-point tablr’
with x in the range [0,:1/2]. To look up a value, we multiply: in
256/77 5 81.5, truncate to an integer and quadruple it to get 1
(4-byte) ﬂoating point address. These operations —includi1§
fetch to the 87stack— take about 1.5-2 fp multiply times, hencl
the speedup is 4-fold.

curl—MW!” 163

The speedup factor does not seem like much, especially for a
function such as sin(.r) that is built into the fast co-processor.
However, if we were speaking of a function that is considerably
slower to evaluate (for example one requiring evaluation of an
integral or solution of a differential equation) bashed table
lookup with interpolation can be several orders of magnitude
faster than direct evaluation.

e now consider how to represent data by mathematical func-
tions. This can be useful in several contexts:

o The theoretical form of the function, but with unknown param-
eters, may be known. One might like to determine the param-
eters from the data. For example, one mi t have a lot of data
on pendulums: their periods, masses, imensions, etc. The
penod of a pendulum IS given, theoretically, by

- a L&
r—(g) f(r’ ."") (23)

where Lis the length of the string, g the acceleration of gravity,
and f is some function of ratios of typical lengths, masses and
other factors in the problem. In order to determine g accurate-
ly, one generally ﬁts a function of all the measured factors, and
tries to minirmze its deviation from the measured periods.
That is, one might try

parameters to be determined.

0 Sometimes one knows that a phenomenon is basically smooth-
ly varying; so that the wiggles and deviations in observations
are noise or otherwise umnteresting. How can we ﬁlter out the
noise without losing the signiﬁcant part of the data? Several
methods have been developed for this gurpose, based on the
same principle: the data are represente as a sum of functions
from a complete set of functions, with unknown coefﬁcients.
That is, if 90.,(x) are the functions, we say (y. are the data)

Such representations are theoretically possible under gene
conditions. Then to ﬁlter we keep on] a ﬁnite sum, retainin
the ﬁrst N (usually simplest and smoot est) functions from th
set. An example of a complete set is monomials, ¢,(x) = x m
Another is sinusoidal (trigonometric) functions,

sin(2:rm.r), cos(27rmx), 0 s x s 1,

used in Fourier-series representation. Gram polynomials, dis
cussed below, comprise a third useful complete set.

The representation in Eq. 25 is called linear because the urts

known coefﬁcients cm appear to their ﬁrst power. Thus, if a”
the data were to double, we see immediately that the cm's would
have to be multiplied by the same factor, 2. Sometimes, as in the
example of the measurement of g above, the unknown paratr~
eters appear in more complicated fashion. The problem of ﬁtting
with these more general functional forms is called nonlinear fon
obvious reasons. The simplex algorithm of Ch. 8 §2.3 below is an
example of a nonlinear ﬁtting procedure.

 

We are now going to write programs to ﬁt both linear and non—
linear functions to data. The ﬁrst and conceptually simplest oﬂ
these is the Fourier transform, namely representing a function as
a sum of sines and cosines.

§§1 Fast Fourier transform
What is a Fourier transform? Suppose we have a function thati
is periodic on the interval 0 s x 5 2m

f(x + 2:) = to);

Then under fairly general conditions the function can be ex~
pressed in the form

f(x) = a0 + E (a, cos(n.r) + b, 5111011)) (26)

11-1

Another way to write Eq. 26 is

f(x) -:§c.ew. (27)

In either way of writing, the c,, are called Fourier coefficients of
the function f(x). booking, e.g., at Eq. 27, we see that the or-
thogonality of the sinusoidal functions leads to the expression

1 _ .
c..=gf3'f(x)e "“411. (28)
Evaluatin£ Eq. 28 numerically requires —for given n- at least

which means carrying out 2N2 complex multiplications.

The fast Fourier transform (FFT) was discovered by Runge and
Konig, rediscovered by Danielzslon and Lanaos and m—redis-
covered by Cooley and Tukeyn. The FFI‘ algorithm can be
expressed as three steps.

To evaluate rapidly the polynomial

k-O
we divide it into two polynomials of order N/Z, dividing each of]
those 1n two, etc. This procedure' IS efﬁcient only for N= 2 ,with,
v an integer, so this IS the case we attack.

How does dividing a polynomial in two help us? If we segregate:
the odd from the even powers, we have, symbolically,

Paw) = EN/2(W2) + w omw’) . (30)

 

Suppose the time to evaluate PN(w) is TN. Then, clearly,

..4._-..~.<-Aanv- .. ‘1

TN = A '1' ”w; (31)

where .1 is the time to segregate the coefﬁcients into odd and even.
plus the time for 2 multiplications and a division. The solution of’
Eq. 31is 1(N-1). That is, it takes 0(N) time to evaluate a poly-
nomial.

However, the discreteness of the Fourier transform helps us here.
The reason is this: to evaluate the transform, we have to evaluate

PN (W) for N values of w, . But wﬁ takes on only N/Z values as 11
takes on N values. Thus to evaluate the Fourier transform for all
N values of n, we can evaluate the two polynomials of order NB
for half as many points.

Suppose we evaluated the polynomials the old-fashioned way: it
would take 2(N/2)= -N multiplications to do both, but we need do
this only N/Z times, and N more (to combine them) so we have
N 2/2 + N rather than N2. We have gained a factor 2. Obviously 1t~‘
pays to repeat the procedure, dividing each of the sub-polyno~
mials in two again, until only monomials are left.

Symbolically, the number of multiplications needed to evaluate,
a polynomial for N (discrete) values of w is s

Although the FFT algorithm can be programmed recursively, it
almost never is. "lb see why, imagine how the coefﬁcients would
be re-shufﬂed by Eq. 30: we work out the case for 16 coefﬁcients,
exhibiting them in Table 8-1 below, writing only the indices:

The crucial columns are “Start” and “Step 3". Unfortunately, they
are written in decimal notation, which conceals a fact that be-
comes glaringly obvious in binary notation. So we re-write them
in binary in the columns Bino and Bin, —and see that the ﬁnal
order can be obtained from the initial order simply by reversing
the order of the bits, from left to right!

standard FORTRAN program for complex FFI‘ is shown below.
e shall simply translate the FORTRAN into FORTH as ex-
peditiously as possible, using some of FOR'IH's simpliﬁcations.

We will use 3.8 to re-order the actual data array (even though
this is slightly more time-consuming than setting up a list of
scrambled pointers. leaving the data alone). We forego indirec-
tion for two reasons: ﬁrst, we have to divide by N (N steps) when
inverse-transforming, so we might as well combine this with
bit-reversal; second, there are N steps in rearranging and dividing
by N the input vector, whereas the FFT itself takes Nlog2(N)
steps, Le. the execution time for the preliminary N steps is unim-
portant.

Now, how do we go about evaluating the sub-polynomials to get
the answer? First, let us write the polynomials (for our case
N = 16) corresponding to taking the (bit-reversed) addresses off
the stack in succession, as in Fig. 8-6 below.

We see that w? (for N=16) has only two possible values, :1.

Thus we must evaluate not 16 x 8 terms like 1’, + w8 fm , but only
2X8. Similarly, we do not need to evaluate 16X4 terms of form
f, + 1941',“ , but only 4X4, since there are only 4 possible values
of w:. Thus the total number of multiplications is

2x8 + 4x4 + 8x2 + 16x1 = 64 a16logz16,

as advertised. This is far fewer than 16X16 =256, and the ratio

improves with N — for example a 1024 point FFT is 100 times
faster than a slow FT.

We list the FFI‘ program on page 191 below. Since }FFT trans '
forms a one-dimensional array we retain the curly braces notation I
introduced in Ch. 5. We want to say something like

new.

V{ n.pts FORWARD }FFT

where V{ is the name of the (complex) array to be transformed,
n.pts (a power of 2) is the size of the array, and the ﬂag-setting ; '
words FORWARD or INVERSE determine whether we are
taking a PET or inverting one.

Now we test the program. Table 8—2 on page 192 contains the L"

weekly stock prices of IBM stock, for the year 1983 (the 52
values have been made complex numbers by adding 01', and the
table padded out to 64 entries (the nearest power of 2) with
complex zeros)22 .T'he ﬁrst two entries (2,64) are the type and
length of the ﬁle. (The ﬁle reads from left to right.)

We FFl‘ Table 8- 2 using the phrase IBM{ 64 DIRECT }FFT. The
power spectrum of the resulting FFI‘ (Table 8-3) is shown in
Fig. 8- 7 on page 192 below.

The usual answer, found by Gauss, is to minimize the squares of
the deviations (at the points xk ) of the ﬁtting function PN (x) from
the data — possibly weighted by the uncertainties of the data That
is, we want to minimize the statistic

From the differential calculus we know that a function’g ﬁrst

respect to each yn independently, and set the results equal to
zero. This yields N + 1 linear equations in N + 1 unknowns:

Orthogonal polynomials play an important role in numerical an:

y%s and applied mathematics. They satisfy (Ithogmality rat
tions of the form

B _ = 1, m=n
I,drw(x)p..(x)p..(x) — a... — {0, ,m (40)
where the weight function w(x) is positive.

For a given w(x) and interval [A,B], we can construct orthogom
polynomials using the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process

Denote the integral in Eq. 40 by (p, , Pm ) to save having to writ
it many times. We start with

p—l = 0 )
-l/2
P007) = (fi dr W(x)) = const. ,

and assume the polynomials satisfy the 2-term upward recursia
relation

Pn+1(x) = (an + xbn ) pn(x) + cup..-1(x) (41)

Now apply Eq. 41: assume we have calculated pn and pr, an
want to calculate 17,“. Clearly, the orthogonality property give:

(Pn+1.Pn)=(Pn+hPn-1)=(Pn:Pn-1)=0a

and the assumed normalization gives

(p...p..)=1-

These relations yields two equations for the three unknowns, 0
bn and C n:

 

23.

Polynomials can be thought of as vectors in a space of inﬁnitely many dimensions (“Hilbert'
space). Certain polynomials are like the vectors that point in the (mutually orthogonal) direc.
tions in ordinary 3-dlmensional space, and so are called «diagonal by analog.

Let us illustrate the process for Legendre polynomials, deﬁned

..................................................................

These are in fact the first three (normalized) Legendre polynom-
ials, as any standard reference will conﬁrm.

Now we can discuss Gram polynomials. While orthogonal poly-

nomials are usually deﬁned with respect to an integral as in
Eq. 40, we might also deﬁne orthogonality in terms of a sum, as
in Eq. 39a. That is, suppose we deﬁne the polynomials such that.

”—1 { 1, m=n

kgopn(xk)pm(xk);:; E dnm = 0, matn (45)

Then we can construct the Gram polynomials, calculating the
coefficients by the algebraic steps of the Gram-Schmidt process.
except now we evaluate sums rather than integrals. Since p..(x)
satisﬁes 45 by construction, the coefﬁcients y, in our ﬁtting
polynomial are simply

they can be evaluated without solving any coupled linear equa

irrelevant.

The required storage is 5 vectors of length M to hold xb p,(xk),

an, c. and the normalizations b. —that is, 3 vectors of length
N < <M— in case they should be needed to interpolate. The time
involved is approximately 7M multiplications and additions for
each n, giving 7NM. Since N can be no greater than M-l (M data
determine at most a polynomial of degree M-l), the maximum
possible running time is 7M2, which is much less than the time to
solve M linear equations.

In practice, we would never wish to ﬁt a polynomial of order

comparable to the number of data, since this would include the
noise as well as the signiﬁcant information

We therefore calculate a statistic called zz/(degrce of freedom)“:
With M data points and an N’th order polynomial, there are
M-N-l degrees of freedom. That is, we evaluate Eq. 38 for ﬁxed
N, and divide by M-N-l. We then increase N by l and do it again
The value of N to stop at is the one where

2
= 1ng
”'2“ M-N-l

stops decreasing (with N) and begins to increase.
The best thing about the xﬁN statistic is we can increase N without
having to do any extra work:

M-l

N
a 2 «oz — 2 (7..)2
k=0 n=0

The ﬁrst term after E in Eq. 47 is independent of N, and the
second term is computed as we go. Thus we could turn the outel
loop (over N) into a BEGIN WHILE REPEAT loop, in

which N is incremented as long as of”; is larger than 02”“ .
(Incidentally, Eq. 47 guarantees that as we increase N the ﬁtted
curve deviates less and less, on the average, from the measured
points. When N = M-l, in fact, the curve goes through the points
But as explained above, this is a meaningless ﬁt, since all data
contain measurement errors. A ﬁtted curve that passes closer
than 0., to more than about 1/3 of the points is suspect.)

The code for Gram polynomials is relatively easy to write using
the techniques developed in Ch. 5. The program is displayed in
full in Appendix 8.4.

ometimes we must ﬁt data by a function that depends on
parameters in a nonlinear manner. An example is

F
‘- 1—7777) “3’

Although the dependence on the parameter F is linear, that on
the parameters a and X is decidedly nonlinear.

One way to handle a problem like ﬁtting Eq. 48 might be to
transform the data, to make the dependence on the parameters
linear. In some cases this is possible, but in 48 no transformation
will render linear the dependence on all three parameters at once.

Thus we are frequently confronted with having to minimize

numerically a complicated function of several parameters. Let
us denote these by 00, 01 , , BN4 , and denote their possible
range of variation by R. Then we want to ﬁnd those values of
{ 0}C R that minimize a positive function:

12 (so, ,UN_,) 101;?" 12(00,...9N-,) (49)

One way to accomplish the minimization is via calculus, using a
method known as steepest descents. The idea is to differentiate
the function 12 with respect to each 0,, and to set the resulting N
equations equal to zero, solving for the N 0’s. This is generally a
pretty tall order, hence various approximate, iterative techniques
have been developed. The simplest just steps along in 0-space,
along the direction of the local downhill gradient -sz, until a
minimum is foun . Then a new gradient is computed, and a new
minimum sought .

Aside fromthe labor of computing -V12, steepest descents has
two main drawbacks: ﬁrst, it only guarantees to ﬁnd a minimum,
not necessarily (In minimum — if a function has several local

rninima, steepest descents will not necessarily ﬁnd the smallest.
Worse, consider a function that has a minimum in the form of a
steep-sided gulley that winds slowly downhill to a declivity —
somewhat like a meandering river's channel. Steepest descents
will then spend all its time bouncing up and down the banks of
the gulley, rather than proceeding along its bottom, since thel
steepest gradient is always nearly perpendicular to the line of thei
channel. 1‘
Sometimes the function 12 is so complex that its gradient is tooI
expensive to compute. Can we ﬁnd a minimum without evaluating}
partial derivatives? A standard way to do this is called the sins?
plex method. The idea is to construct a simplex — a set of N +1
distinct and non-degenerate vertices in the N-dimensional 0-
space (“non-degenerate" means the geometrical object, formed
by connecting the N + 1 vertices with straight lines, ha non-zero
N-dimensional volume; for example, if N=2, the simplex is a
triangle.)

We evaluate the function to be minimized at each of the vertices,
and sort the table of vertices by the size of 12 at each vertex, the
best (smallest x2 ) on top, the worst at the bottom. The simplex
algorithm then chooses a new point in 0-space by the a strategy,
expressed as the ﬂow diagram, Fig. 8-8 on page 203 below, thd
in action somewhat resembles the behavior of an amoeba seeking
its food. The key word )MINIMIZE that implements the complex
decision tree in Fig. 8-8 (given here in pseudocode) is

§§1 Gaussian quadrature

aussian quadrature formulae are based on the following idea:

if we let the points 6,, and weights wll be 2N free parameters
(n runs from 1 to N), what values of them most accurately repre-
sent an integral by the formula

B N
I = [A dx a(x)f(x) = E1 w,,f(§,,) ? (50)

In Eq. 50 0(x) is a (known) positive function and f(x) is the
function we want to integrate. This problem can actually be
solved, and leads to tables of points 5,, and weight coefﬁcients
w,, speciﬁc to a particular interval [A,B] and weight function a(x).
Gauss-Legendre integration pertains to [-1,+1] and o(x)= 1.
(Note any interval can be transformed into [-1, + 1].)

The interval [0,00) and 0(x) = e"r leads to Gauss-Laguerre for-

2
mulae, whereas the interval (— oo,+ 00) and 0(x) = e”Jr leads to
Gauss-Hermite formulae.

Finally, we note that the more common integration formulae such
as Simpson’s rule or the trapezoidal rule can be derived on the
same basis as the Gauss methods, except that the points are spe-
ciﬁed in advance to be equally spaced and to include the end-
points of the interval. Only the weights w, can be determined as
free ﬁtting parameters that give the best approximation to the”
integral.

For given N Gaussian formulae can be more accurate than equally-
spaced rules, as they have twice as many parameters to play with.

PO LATE performs Richardson extrapolation for the trapezoid»
a1 "rule. The idea' is this. If we use a given rule, accurate to order
w’I ,to calculate the integral on an interval [a,b], then presumably
the error of using the formula on each half of the interval and
adding the results, will be smaller by 2'". For the trapezoidal rule,
n =2, hence we expect the error from summing two half-inter-

Thus, we can write (10 = I: , I'o = I£a+by2 , I, = ﬂaw/2 )

Equation 52b is only an approximation because the R that ap-
pears in it is not exactly the same as R in Eq. 52a. We will pretend
the two R’s are equal, however, and eliminate R from the two
