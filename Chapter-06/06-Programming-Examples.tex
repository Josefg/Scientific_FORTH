This chapter illustrates how we may apply the ﬂoating poin
extensions of FORTH, developed in preceding chapters, t4
some standard problems in numerical analysis.

51 Infinite series

Frequently we must evaluate a function deﬁned by an inﬁnil
sum

ID) = 2 Cut" (1)

n=0
where x is a real number and c. is an inﬁnite sequence 0
coefﬁcients. The extensive mathematical theory1 of such fun:
tions can be summarized as follows: the series of terms only ha
meaning if —for ﬁxedx — the sequence of partial sums

N—l
fn(x) = E cnxn (2)

n=0

has a definite limit.

§§1 Examples of Inﬁnite series
erhaps the formal deﬁnitions will seem clearer after sorn
concrete examples. We now examine some divergent an
convergent series.

§§1—1 Divergent examples
What does it mean to say a series diverges? Consider the seric
whose terms are all 1's (that is, c,I = 1, x= 1):

1+1+1+1+... (3)

The partial sum fN is just N, and therefore increases without lint
as more terms are added. The series diverges.

 

1. The Handbook of Mathematical Function: ed. Milton Abramowitz and Irene Stegun (Dover H
lications, Inc, New York, 1965) — henceforth abbreviated HMF- is a mine of useful informa-
tion and references, on this as well as many other aspects of numerical analysis.

cums-Wm 117

A harder case is the series whose terms are alternately 1's and
-1's:

1—1+1-1+1—... (4)

Depending on how the terms are grouped together, the partial
sums can have any value. Certainly the partial sums do not settle
down to any deﬁnite value. The series diverges.

Yet a third case is the harmonic series

111.1

fN =1+2+3+- +. .+N. (5)

It can be shown that for large N, f" is approximately log¢(N), so
the harmonic series diverges.

§§1—2 A convergent example
Are there ever mes of inﬁnite series that do mean something?
Obviously, or there could hardly be a theory of them! An ex-
ample2 is c. = 1 , x = V: . Here the partial sums

do have a deﬁnite limit, so the series converges.

552 Numerical examples of convergent series
How do we tell whether a series has converged? As a practice
matter, we keep adding temis to the partial sum until it rs
longer changes, within the desired precision. Sometimes this ca
involve a great many terms, even when the series converges.
There exists an extensive mathematical literature on testing in
the convergence of an inﬁnite series. Mathematicians have ale
developed many tricks for accelerating the convergence of slowt
converging series3. Consulting the literature in difﬁcult cases i
strongly recommended — it can save time galore!

As an heuristic exercise, let us write some simple programs in
evaluate partial sums and see how convergence works.

First we sum the terms 2'“ from Eq. 6. The ﬂow diagram is sham
in Fig. 6-1 below.

The partial sums converge rapidly to 2 (which, as we saw in §1. 1.2
above, is the exact sum).

For a second example, let us sum a standard inﬁnite series repre-
sentation for :rr/4: We note that the function tan 1(x) (that is,
' arctan(x) ) has the infinite series representation

 

i. M, cs 4 9.42.

Actually the series Eq. 8 is slowly converging and therefore a poor

The ﬁrst thing we notice is that the numbers seem to be converg-
ing to something; however, unlike the previous series, the differ-
ences between successive partial sums are fairly large.

An inﬁnite series of terms that alterna e in sign and decrease in
magnitude is. guaranteed to converge . The error (that is, the
difference between a partial sum and the limit) is of the order of

the first neglected term and has the same sign. We see that for
this case, the error in computing rt is of order 2Jn, where n is the
number of terms in the sum. To get It to 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures,‘
therefore, we need about 1000 terms! This is why the series
representation for 4tan 1( 1)‘ rs not a very good way to calculate a.
A better way uses e. g. .,

7r 16tan (5) 4tan (239),

which converges much faster9.

it and leaves the result on the appropriate stack (87stack, fstacii

“3-1 Function calls In FORTRAN

achieves readability by passing arguments to functions in a list. In
fact, function names can also be passed in the argument list. 111115,

summing an inﬁnite series could be written

§§3-2 A function erI tor FORTH

We would like to extend to FORTH FORTRAN’s ability to write
a generic series summation function, passing the variable and the
name of the coefﬁcient function as arguments. In other words, we
now face the task of devising the function protocol we plan to use
throughout the rest of the book and in our future programming
— a heavy responsibility since we do not know what form these
future programs will take. For once we must engage in top-dawn
programming!

We want our protocol to have several features:
s it must be telegraphic, i.e. it must immediately suggest what it

is doing — a matter of choosing good names.

e it must be simple to implement and easy to remember — the
advantages of using it must not be outweighed by complexity.

e it must be fast — a major drawback to FORTRAN's way ol
doing things is the overhead in function calls.

e It must be portable — it cannot depend on specific details 0
the FORTH implementation or the machine 1t 1s running on.

It is simpler to thread this particular maze in reverse: begin with
where we want to end up, and determine what steps got us there.
We suppose we have deﬁned a generic power series summation
function, using the lfstack deﬁned in Ch. 5 52595:

: SUMPOWERS (87zerr-- 21x --surn)
E G! \storeerror

DUP G=1 \x“0
G=0 0 DUP --n=0 ::--x 10)

(--n::--xx“nc[n])
3 GPICK G' F>FS
(--n::--xx“ntermsum)
ENUF? NOT WHILE
G+
REPEAT G+ CLEANUP ;

AAA

The words E, ENUF? and CLEANUP have straightforward
deﬁnitions with obvious meanings; mine has not been deﬁned
because we have yet to ﬁgure out what it will do.

Manifestly, edr.c must place the execution address (“code-ﬁeld
address" — cfa) on the stack for EXECUTE to ﬁnd. There are
several ways to accomplish this. Clearly, we want to keep the
variable that holds the cfa local, so it will not get confused with
another function’s cfa. While it is straightforward to deﬁne a
variable and then make it headerless —hence local— (via
BEHEAD", e.g.) we would prefer to avoid defining a variable at
all. Here is a perfect opportunity to use the return stack (rstack).

We imagine that SUMPOWERS expects the cfa of the function
c. on the stack. Then the first thing SUM.POWERS must do is
stash the cfa somewhere convenient but local. One such place is
the stack itself. Even easier, since SUMPOWERS does not use
the rstack explicitly (e.g. in a DO LOOP), is to let the ﬁrst step
in SUMPOWERS be > R. Then the code for adr.c would be
merely R@. The ﬁnal word, after invoking CLEAN.UP (that
drops unwanted items from the various stacks), then must be
RDROP (for systems without it, : RDROP R > DROP ; ).

A transcendental equation has the form

ﬂx) = 0, (10)

where f(x) is a transcendental function rather than, say, a polyno-
mial or ratio of polynomials10 (rational function).

There are several standard methods for ﬁnding a (or possibly, the)
value of x that satisﬁes this equation, i.e. a root of Eq. 10 (which
might have many or no roots). '1?) guarantee that we ﬁnd a root
we must know an interval of the x-axis that it certainly will be
found in. 'Iirr'o methods that can be applied under these circum-
stances are binomial search and regula falsl .

ssr Binary search

Let us look ﬁrst at binomial search, since its algorithm is euy to

understand. We know some interval, It. s x 5 xx, contains a
root because f(x) changes sign when .1: goes from xL -xn . In
pseudocode (and FORTH ﬂow chart) the binomial search algo-
rithm is shown in Fig. 6-3 on page 128.

The method begins with upper and lower bounds on x that capture
the root. Next we look at f(xAV) halfway between xL and xglf
f =f(xAV) has the same sign as fL= f(xL), the new left end of the
interval becomes X". If the signs are opposite, xAV becomes the
new right end of the interval. The algorithm is done when left and
right ends agree within some predetermined accuracy.

Binary search has the following virtues: the time it takes to
achieve a given accuraqr is predictable, and it is guaranteed to
ﬁnd a captured root. Creating a FORTH program from the
pseudocode skeleton of Fig. 6-3 is left as an exercise.

Now we look at regula falsi, Latin for “rule of false approach"
Here the basic premise is:

0 Assume the root lies in the interval (x1, x3, and plot a straigli
line between the points (XL, fL) and (XE, f . l

o This line must intersect the_x-axis somewhere in the inte
and we take that point, call It x’, as our next guess.

a If x’ is to the left of the root, ad'ust the interval accordingly, an
the same if x’ is to the right 0 the root.

As Fig. 6-4 on page 129 shows, the straight line is supposed
approximate the curve [(15). The new guess may be much closer

the root than is the midpoint of the interval (which was the neat
guess in binomial search).

Let us now compare the two algorithms for functions f(x,t) th:
lead to singular solutions. This time we consider the equation

The results of doing this with straight-, and then implicit Runge-
Kutta are displayed in Fig. 6-12 (p. 140) and 6-13 (p. 141), respec-
tively. We only show the second half of the interval (near the
singular point) in either case.

The straight Runge-Kutta algorithm, without the fancy implicit
solution for r(t +h), appears more accurate near the singularity,
although both methods are acceptably accurate. Does this mean
implicit Runge-Kutta is no good? No!

The implicit scheme lost accuracy through roundoff: the arith-
metic was insufficiently precise. To take advantage of the
method’s power, we must increase the precision beyond one part
in 106. This requires changing all scalars to 64—bit precision
(REAL‘S) rather than 32-bit as we have done here. The generic
fetch/store techniques developed in Chapter 5 and used here,
permit this change with a minimum of fuss. We leave this as an
exercise.
